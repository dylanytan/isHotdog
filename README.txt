This is a project for my AP Enviormental Science Project

The target of this project is to determine the difficulty and accessability of setting up modern tensorflow to 
create AI image classification learning models

The above target will be accomplished by attempting to create a model that replicates the "is hotdog" app from the show silicon valley
